It has educated more than 20,000 students across 40 institutions, investing over ‚Çπ100 crores.</p>
<hr>
    <p>Our legacy includes visits from great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The Sangha, founded in 1903 by Poojya Doddappa Appa, has empowered generations by delivering meaningful, inclusive education with service and excellence.</p>
<hr>
    <p> It made a humble, yet a noble beginning with its first school housed in Mahadasoha Mahamane - the spiritual abode where Lord Sharnbasveshwar lived. Since then, it has never looked back and has grown into leaps and bounds, dedicating itself to the pursuit of service and excellence. In the course of time, it has grown into a mammoth educational centre imparting Science, Commerce, Arts, Management, Vocational, Engineering and Technical education to nearly Twenty Thousand Students from LKG to PG in forty institutions spending nearly hundred crore in the span of hundred years of its meaningful and eventful existence.</p>
